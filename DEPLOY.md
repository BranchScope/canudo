# DEPLOY GUIDE
Ok, I mean, I dockerized it for a reason...\
**DISCLAIMER:** this guide doesn't include what's inside `cron`, it's just another project I will fix when my love for [brown eyed girls](https://youtu.be/UfmkgQRmmeE) ends, so never. 

## Installation & requirements
- Install docker for your system
- `git clone https://github.com/BranchScope/canudo`

## Start
- `cd canudo`
- `docker-compose up -d`

## Logging
- `docker-compose logs` or run the `up` command without the flag `-d` (just in case you didn't know how to use docker lmao)

## Contribution
[Contact me](https://t.me/BranchScope) or just make a PR.
