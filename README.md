# Hi there
This repo shares with you the infra behind [Canudo News](https://t.me/+BkQwfCwewCxkZjhk) and [Canudo Libri](https://t.me/+hyLW-12n5To3OWU0), two project made by a unknown little boy studying at Canudo High School (applied sciences). I am also known as the "worst" student of Helali, so don't expect code written like Linus Torvalds does, I mean, I barely know how to start up a computer, right Mr. Helali?

# Current status of infra and TODOs
### Canudo News [stopped for maintenance]
TODO:
- Duplicate when a post is pinned on the website
- Optimization and a more readable code

### Canudo Libri [work in progress]
TODO:
- Dockerize everything
- Set up graphics
- Optimize the code (maybe)
