# 👋 Hi there
This repo shares with you the infrastructure behind [Canudo News](https://t.me/+BkQwfCwewCxkZjhk) and [Canudo Libri](https://t.me/+hyLW-12n5To3OWU0), two project made by a semi-unknown little boy studying at Canudo High School (applied sciences). I am also known as the "worst" student of teacher Helali, so don't expect code written like Linus Torvalds does, I mean, I barely know how to start up a computer, right Mr. Helali?
